Since Oxford says some words are valid both ways, I kept both and the user decides which he prefers. A good example is: \"online\" and \"on-line\".\nFor ize/ise, both ways are accepted in some words:\n— optimize/optimise: https://lexico.com/en/definition/optimize;\n— realize/realise: https://lexico.com/en/definition/realize.\nOxford Dictionaries will only refer that certain words accept both ize/ise for Premium accounts.\nThe regular user won't know by accessing the Oxford site, but I have access to it.\n\nPlaces from New Zealand/UK (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland):\nOn V2.61–2.64 I included tons of place names.\nMy scientist friend, Peter McGavin, told me that in NZ they use British, so I decided to do something about it. I did the same for UK. I searched on Wikipedia for \"towns\", \"counties\", \"villages\", \"boroughs\", \"suburbs\", etc. and based me on:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_England;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_New_Zealand;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_England;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_Scotland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_in_Scotland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communities_in_Wales;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Wales;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_villages_in_Northern_Ireland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Northern_Ireland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suburbs_in_New_Zealand;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes.\nAlso, added places sent to me by Peter C.:\n© OpenStreetMap contributors: www.openstreetmap.org/copyright.\n© The Clergy of the Church of England Database Project, 2005.\n\nCities from Australia\nOn V2.65 I added the cities in Australia by population, since they are in valid English:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Australia_by_population.\n\nCities from US\nOn V2.65 I added tons of cities in the US with a 10 000+ population, since they are in valid English.\nThis list was supplied by Michael Holroyd on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\n\nCities from Canada\nOn V2.67 I added the cities in Canada, since they are in valid English:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Canada.\n\nState and union territory capitals in India\nOn V2.90 I added this list to the dictionary, since they are in valid English:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_state_and_union_territory_capitals_in_India.\n\nCommon prescription and OTC drugs\nOn V2.63 I added tons of drugs names supplied by Andrew Ziem on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\nThe generic drugs (such as \"diphenhydramine\") are in lowercase, while the brand names (such as \"Abilify\") are capitalised.\n\nWords regarding COVID-19\nOn V2.83 I added tons of entries regarding the pandemic.\n\nMain difficulties developing this dictionary:\n1) Proper names;\n2) Possessive forms;\n3) Plurals.\n\nAdding new words:\nIf you believe to have found a missing/incorrect word, please send it to me for analysis. If it is on the Oxford or Collins dictionaries, I will add it.\n\nRemoving US words:\nIf you find American words, which appear both in Oxford and Collins dictionaries as such with a British correspondence, please send them to me for analysis and removal.\n\nArchaic words:\nI will only add archaic words if they don't interfere with other words.\n\n\nI developed Proofing Tool GUI (open-source tool) hoping someone would improve the GB speller, but months went by and no one volunteered, so I took the task myself in 2013.\n\nI have created the best up-to-date British speller. It encompasses several fields of knowledge, from simple to complex words.\n\nIt doesn't matter your religion, sex, age or academic background, everyone should have access to all words equally for free.\n\nTo make sure the words I add are the correct ones, I have been looking for them in credible sources:\n1) Oxford Dictionaries;\n2) Collins Dictionary;\n3) Macmillan Dictionary;\n4) Cambridge Dictionary;\n5) Merriam-Webster Dictionary (used with caution ⚠);\n6) Wiktionary (used with caution ⚠);\n7) Wikipedia (used with caution ⚠);\n8) Physical dictionaries.\n\nIn January 2015 I purchased an \"Oxford Gold Account\" to have a higher access in Oxford Dictionaries.\n\nI am also involved on several projects with a specific jargon having added some \"special\" words.\n\nI am adding the words with copy/paste after checking them in the dictionaries mentioned above. This is slower and harder, but the results are much better and accurate.\n\nOn 25.Aug.2013 I released a \"forked\" V2.00. The speller has been made available to OpenOffice, LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey. So far, I have added 111 251+ words (as of V2.91).","weeklyDownloads":6307,"type":"dictionary","creator":{"name":"Marco A.G.Pinto","url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-GB/thunderbird/user/marcoagpinto/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/full/205/205868.png?modified=1599197679","width":610,"height":330,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/205/205868.png?modified=1599197679","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":173,"caption":"Installing the dictionary on Thunderbird (2019-12-25)"},{"url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/full/205/205869.png?modified=1599197679","width":453,"height":214,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/205/205869.png?modified=1599197679","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":151,"caption":"Activating the dictionary on Thunderbird (current e-mail) (2019-12-25)"},{"url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/full/205/205870.png?modified=1599197679","width":610,"height":393,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/205/205870.png?modified=1599197679","thumbnailWidth":310,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Activating the dictionary on Thunderbird (all e-mails) (2019-12-25)"},{"url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/full/206/206129.png?modified=1599197640","width":1280,"height":626,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/206/206129.png?modified=1599197640","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":157,"caption":"Open-source tool used in the speller (V3.0 build 183)"},{"url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/full/206/206130.png?modified=1599197682","width":1280,"height":626,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/206/206130.png?modified=1599197682","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":157,"caption":"Open-source tool used in the speller (V3.0 build 183)"},{"url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/full/206/206131.png?modified=1599197684","width":1280,"height":626,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/206/206131.png?modified=1599197684","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":157,"caption":"Open-source tool used in the speller (V3.0 build 183)"}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/marcoagpinto/4eur","averageRating":4.5584,"reviewCount":57,"reviewURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-GB/thunderbird/addon/british-english-dictionary-2/reviews/","updateDate":1606782003000},{"id":"langpack-en-GB@thunderbird.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-32.png","64":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/static/img/addon-icons/default-64.png"},"name":"English (GB) Language Pack (Thunderbird)","version":"78.0buildid20201019003438","sourceURI":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/downloads/file/1017704/english_gb_language_pack_thunderbird-78.0buildid20201019003438-tb.xpi?src=","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":null,"description":"English (GB) Language Pack (Thunderbird)","fullDescription":null,"weeklyDownloads":1488,"type":"locale","creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-GB/thunderbird/user/mozilla/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":null,"averageRating":2,"reviewCount":22,"reviewURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-GB/thunderbird/addon/english-gb-language-pack-thund/reviews/","updateDate":1603739104000},{"id":"MonterailFullDark2@conema.me","icons":{"32":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/addon_icons/987/987727-32.png?modified=76d8985d","64":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/addon_icons/987/987727-64.png?modified=76d8985d"},"name":"Monterail Full Dark 2 for TB>68","version":"3.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/downloads/file/1017607/monterail_full_dark_2_for_tb68-3.1-tb.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://github.com/conema/monterail-fulldark","supportURL":"https://github.com/conema/monterail-fulldark","description":"Monterail Full Dark, a Thunderbird theme inspired by the mockup of Monterail","fullDescription":"WARNING Thunderbird >v68\nThe last version (3.0) is only compatible with Thunderbird 78.x.\nFor TB = 68: here.\nFor TB < 68: here.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a full theme for the Thunderbird e-mail client, inspired by Monterail mockup and by spymastermatt's fulldark theme.

With this workaround it'll work:\n        Go where your application data are stored, they usually can be found in:\n            Windows: `C:\\Users\\[your windows user]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Thunderbird\\Profiles\\[(literally) random letters and numbers].default/`\n            Linux: `/home/[your linux user]/.thunderbird/[(literally) random letters and numbers].default/`\n            MacOS: `/home/[your macos user]/Library/Thunderbird/Profiles/[(literally) random letters and numbers].default/`\n        Go to the \"extensions\" folder, here there should be a file named \"MonterailFullDark@conema.me.xpi\"\n        While Thunderbird is opened in background, delete the \"MonterailFullDark@conema.me.xpi\" file.\n        Restart Thunderbird and reinstall the theme\n        Restart Thunderbird again, the theme now should work\n    The Light version will be released?\n    Yes, but for the moment it is better to completely finish the dark/fulldark version, after that, the creation of others version will fast as a snap of fingers.\n\n    The original Monterail version will be released?\n    Nope, it already exists: Monterail by Paenglab.\n\n    This theme should work with Windows/Linux/MacOS?\n    Yes and no. Currently the theme have been tested only on Windows 10 and Fedora (native, snap). In theory there should not be problems, otherwise you are free to open an issue here on GitHub.\n\n    With which versions of Thunderbird can I use this theme?\n    The last version (3.0) can be used only with Thunderbird 78. The previous version (2.1) can be used with Thunderbird 68.","weeklyDownloads":0,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"conema","url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-GB/thunderbird/user/conema/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/full/205/205835.png?modified=1574106988","width":427,"height":451,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/205/205835.png?modified=1574106988","thumbnailWidth":189,"thumbnailHeight":200},{"url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/full/205/205836.png?modified=1574106990","width":848,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/205/205836.png?modified=1574106990","thumbnailWidth":212,"thumbnailHeight":200},{"url":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/full/205/205837.png?modified=1574106990","width":1200,"height":643,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/205/205837.png?modified=1574106990","thumbnailWidth":320,"thumbnailHeight":171}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":3.8667,"reviewCount":15,"reviewURL":"https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-GB/thunderbird/addon/monterail-full-dark-2/reviews/","updateDate":1602509782000}],"compatOverrides":[]}
